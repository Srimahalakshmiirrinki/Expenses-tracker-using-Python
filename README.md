# Expenses-tracker-using-Python

In this Project i Started exploring Python and learning more.

Aim: To Create a tracker for my Daily Expenses.

Tools: I Used Visual Studio Code editior to write code and execute. It helps me in debugging and running program easily.

Input: Need to give expenses for the Day as input.

Target: I Want to improve this program to next level Like detailed expense tracker for my daily expenses.

Observations:

While exploring Python, i understand python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. 
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages like Java,C#. 
I am looking forward to do more in Python.
